## Functional Consistency

1. Interactions

2. Controls and Components

## Reduce user frustration

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common cause of user frustration happens when it’s not clear what to do next. Some tasks are not so self-explanatory, but UI and UX designers are often too close to it to notice.

## Use clear navigation tools

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain a consistent placement of navigation elements (e.g., menu bars, tabs) across all pages of the application or website. Users should know where to find navigation tools without having to search for them.

## Make it accessible

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating accessible navigation in UX/UI design is crucial to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can easily navigate through your application or website. Here are some specific strategies to make navigation accessible

## Analysis & Planning


1. Analysis

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phase involves gathering insights into user needs, behaviors, and preferences through methods like user research, competitive analysis, and usability testing.

2. Planing

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, goals and objectives are defined, and strategic decisions are made regarding information architecture, interaction design, and visual aesthetics. Wireframing, prototyping, and iterative testing refine concepts, ensuring a well-structured and user-friendly interface.

## Use Correct Contrast Color for Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast is everything on a visual composition. When you have
low contrast between your interface elements, all of the elements merge together and you end up with a dull and hard-to-read interface because it all looks the same. Low contrast is equal to low usability.

## Don't Use Confusing Forms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms are a crucial part of the user journey; they are used to login, to
sign up, check out, etc. So it's important to provide clear guidance before and after submitting the form.

## Design a clear popup for user experience

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involves creating a concise and visually appealing popup that effectively communicates information or prompts action without disrupting the user's workflow. Key elements include a straightforward message, minimal text, an intuitive layout, and a prominent call-to-action. Ensuring the popup is easy to dismiss and contextually relevant enhances user satisfaction and engagement.

## Hopping on every design trend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like fashion, music, and hairstyles, the design space is full of UX trends that come and go. While it’s important to stay up-to-date with trends, don’t feel pressured to go along with everything you hear about just because it’s a trend. intuitive layout, and a prominent call-to-action. Ensuring the popup is easy to dismiss and contextually relevant enhances user satisfaction and engagement.

## Support icon with text

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In UX/UI design, a support icon with text typically serves as a clear, visual cue to users that they can access help or support-related information. This icon, often represented by a question mark inside a circle or another universally recognized symbol for assistance, is accompanied by concise text to reinforce its purpose.

## Use Clear Delete Modal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay extra attention to your buttons' copies.Avoid generic out-of-context copies, like 'Yes' or 'No'.Instead, use a sentence to communicate clearly the button's actions.

## Highlight The Best Offer In Your Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always highlight your best pricing plan and make it pop out.
In that way, you help users identify the most used plan and you promote your top offer. It's a win-win situation.To highlight the plan, use more than one design ways, eg. color, size, elevation.

##  Design Better Menus In Your Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menus have readability issues very often. A quick hack to make them look and function better is to add an icon next to every action. In that way, you help users visually identify actions without having to read the whole copy.Also, it's a good practice to highlight the active tab, if it's applicable to the menu's use case.

##  Always Have A CTA in Website Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always have a CTA button on your website's above the fold section Many of your visitors might never scroll down your landing page. So you need to offer them an option to convert immediately.

##  De-emphasize Dangerous Actions in Your Popups

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always try to de-emphasize dangerous actions like deletion. You have to prioritize the default action instead of the dangerous/irreversible one. Also, use more than one trait to make the element look like a secondary action (color, size, type, placement, etc).

##  How to Apply the Brand Color

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors are a core element for any user interface. One of the most common mistakes in UI design is the over usage of the brand color. Avoid it by highlighting only the most important elements of your interface with your primary color. For the rest of the elements, combine tints & shades of your main color.

##  Use Better Link Button in your design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links are important and you need to treat their appearance nicely.Many times a traditional button works better than a single link.Especially if the link is not on a header, footer, or the body of an article.Always make the copy actionable and hint at the action they initiate.

##  Prompt User to Scroll When You Design Any Website

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your website needs to prompt users to scroll to communicate your product's value better.Especially when the header content is not enough to describe your product's value. A simple hack to prompt users to scroll is by showing them a glimpse of the next section. In that way, the user knows there is more information on the site and becomes curious to explore it further.

##  Make Cards Look Clickable in Your Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, cards fail to indicate that they're clickable.Designers omit CTA buttons and only count on the user's experience or/and, hover effects. In design, it's always a good practice to never leave things on user imagination. Instead use an actionable button to prompt clickability and describe the action.
